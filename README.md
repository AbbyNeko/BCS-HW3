# Password Generator

Password Generator is a web application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. When you click the button to generate the passsword, the app will ask you to specify the length of your password, and the character types you want to use. 

User input will be validated by the app and an alert will be shown if you leave any prompts blank or request a password length less than 8 or greater than 128. The finished password will display in the text input above the button.
